🌦 Weather-Trend Forecasting: A Machine Learning Approach
📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze weather trends, predict future weather conditions using machine learning models, and uncover insights from climate data. The project leverages Random Forest, LSTM, and an Ensemble Model, with a focus on accurate time series forecasting.

Key Goals:
✅ Forecast weather conditions based on historical data
✅ Compare traditional and deep learning approaches
✅ Explore environmental and climate impact analyses
✅ Identify geographical patterns in weather trends

📊 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
📌 Data Source
The dataset consists of historical weather data, including features like temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and air quality indices.

📌 Preprocessing Steps:
✔ Handling Missing Values – Used interpolation & mean imputation
✔ Feature Engineering – Created new features like temperature deviation, seasonality factors
✔ Normalization – Scaled data using MinMaxScaler for LSTM
✔ Train-Test Split – Divided data into 80% train, 20% test

🔍 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Key Insights from EDA
📈 Seasonal Trends: Temperature fluctuations over seasons
🌍 Geographical Analysis: Weather conditions vary significantly across regions
📊 Feature Correlations:

Temperature is highly correlated with humidity & pressure
Wind speed shows a negative correlation with temperature
Air quality worsens in extreme temperature conditions
📌 Visualizations
✅ Time Series Trends: Temperature & humidity variations over time
✅ Heatmaps: Correlation between weather features
✅ Boxplots & Histograms: Distribution of weather parameters
✅ Geospatial Mapping: Weather variations across different locations

🤖 3. Forecasting Models & Evaluations
📌 Models Implemented:
1️⃣ Random Forest Regressor – Traditional ML model for time series forecasting
2️⃣ LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) – Deep learning model for sequence prediction
3️⃣ Ensemble Model (Random Forest + LSTM) – Hybrid approach for better accuracy

📌 Model Performance Metrics
Model	R² Score	Accuracy (%)
Random Forest	0.9995	85.6%
LSTM (Before Inverse Scaling)	73.11%	
LSTM (After Inverse Scaling)	95%	
Ensemble Model	0.9998	93.5%
👉 Final Model Chosen: LSTM (After inverse scaling, it achieved 95% accuracy)

📈 4. Advanced Analyses & Insights
📌 Climate Analysis
Long-Term Patterns: Temperature has been rising over the years
Anomaly Detection: Detected unusual weather conditions (e.g., heatwaves)
📌 Environmental Impact Analysis
Correlation Between Air Quality & Weather:
Poor air quality is associated with higher temperatures & low wind speed
Rainfall improves air quality by reducing pollutants
📌 Feature Importance Analysis
Used SHAP values and Permutation Importance to understand which weather factors contribute the most to predictions:
✔ Temperature: Most important predictor
✔ Humidity & Pressure: Strong secondary predictors
✔ Wind Speed: Minor impact

📌 Spatial Analysis & Geographical Patterns
Weather Conditions by Region: Mapped temperature & humidity across different cities
Clustering Analysis: Grouped similar weather regions using K-Means
🏆 5. Key Insights & Conclusions
✅ Deep Learning (LSTM) outperformed traditional ML models in time series forecasting
✅ Air quality is significantly impacted by weather conditions
✅ Geographical patterns reveal variations in climate trends across different regions
✅ Feature importance analysis confirms that temperature, humidity, and pressure drive weather patterns
